# TODO: Train AI Agent Model for Better Learning and Accuracy

## Tasks
- [x] Improve knowledge retrieval function in main.py for better accuracy (add scoring based on word overlap).
- [x] Add threshold logic: If high-confidence knowledge is found, use it without searching.
- [x] Update system prompt to prioritize stored knowledge and reduce unnecessary searches.
- [x] Add manual training/review feature: Allow user to add/correct knowledge entries.
- [x] Implement feedback loop: Log when knowledge is used vs. searched for benchmarking.
- [x] Test with sample queries to verify reduced searching and improved accuracy.
