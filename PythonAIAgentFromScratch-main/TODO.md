# TODO: Modify AI Agent for General Assistance and Benchmarking

## Tasks
- [x] Update system prompt in main.py to focus on general assistance, step-by-step reasoning, and accurate responses (remove research-specific elements).
- [x] Remove Pydantic parser and ResearchResponse model for flexible, natural output.
- [x] Implement multi-turn conversation loop in main.py for ongoing interaction.
- [x] Add performance logging in main.py to track queries, responses, and tool usage for benchmarking.
- [x] Test the agent with sample queries to ensure it understands intent and reasons step-by-step.
- [x] Optimize for benchmark performance (e.g., ensure concise, correct answers; handle edge cases).
- [x] Run benchmarks if possible (e.g., using tools to simulate or log scores).
