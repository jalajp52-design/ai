Absolutely! You can now run your agent with one click or one command directly inside Antigravity:

Option 1: The "Slash Command" (Easiest)
Whenever you want to start your server, just type this in our chat:

/run

I have set up a Workflow for you. When you type /run, I will automatically:

Kill any stuck servers.
Fix your dependencies.
Launch the AI Agent for you.
Option 2: Double-Click in Windows
If you are outside of this chat, you can simply double-click the file named 
START_AGENT.bat
 in your project folder. It will do exactly the same thing.

Why this is better:
You don't need to remember commands like python app.py.
You don't need to worry about "Port already in use" errors.
Everything is handled for you automatically.
Try it right now! Type /run in the chat and watch the agent start up perfectly. 🚀🤖
